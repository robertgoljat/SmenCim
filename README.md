Description:
* The file-path under `-n` switch points to source file generated by CIMTool from EA (Enterprise Architect).
* The `-v` switch defines the verb type according to standard (`Get` for data querying, `Reply` for events, `Request` for commands, etc.)
* The `-o` switch points to output directory

### Example:

```
cimtowsdl -n raw\SomeNoun.xsd -v Get -o wsdl -c
cimtowsdl -n raw\SomeNoun.xsd -v Request -o wsdl -c
cimtowsdl -n raw\SomeNoun.xsd -v Reply -o wsdl -c
```

These three commands will create all necessary XSDs and WSDLs required for building SOAP services and/or clients.
